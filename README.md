# EVE Map Data

A graph of [EVE Online](http://www.eveonline.com/)'s (non-wormhole) systems in JSON format (both pretty-printed and "compressed"), generated from the [static data export](http://wiki.eve-id.net/CCP_Static_Data_Export)

The given `convert.rb` script reads from a local sqlite database. Used a conversion from https://www.fuzzwork.co.uk/dump/rubicon-1.2-94438/
